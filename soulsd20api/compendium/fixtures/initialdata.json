Over the course of a long rest you may spend 4-5 days of hard work (2-3 days if you are a Grme, but still only once per long rest) near a magical bonfire/resting area to alter the scaling on one non-catalyst weapon and/or fully repair any of its durability loss, by using the magic of the bonfire/resting place. You may lower the weapons already existing physical or elemental scaling in a stat by one level (A to B, B to C etc.) and increase its physical or elemental scaling in a different stat by one level, up to a maximum of S scaling (adding/increasing strength or dexterity for physical scaling, or intelligence or faith for elemental scaling). Although, this can not add a new damage type to the weapon. If the stat scaling you are decreasing is at E, then it is removed. If the stat scaling that you are increasing does not already exist on that weapon, then it is increased to E. As well, adding a new stat scaling to a weapon which doesn’t already have a requirement for it, gives it a requirement of 10 in that stat. A weapon's scaling may have up to two alterations in this way, and an alteration from this feat can be reversed and removed through the same process. Weapons altered through this feat are more valuable and may sell for a greater price, and through your experience with them you have an easier time identifying and perceiving the quality of weapons.\n   In addition to the other effects of this feat, while away from a bonfire/magical resting place, you may use your skills and whatever materials you have to apply a quick fix to a weapon wielded by yourself or a nearby ally. This quick fix costs 3 AP to do in combat and increases the weapons durability by 2d4, but allows the weapon to be more easily damaged again. As a result, the durability loss thresholds for negative effects on that weapon are lowered by two until its user gets it properly repaired (applies a non quick fix durability increasing effect to it). So for example, weapon scaling would be reduced/removed at 3 durability damage and weapons are broken at 8 durability damage, instead of 5 and 10 respectively. This negative effect can stack if you make multiple quick fixes on the same weapon before it is restored."

Any humans under this light upon it initially being cast have their undying stacks reduced to zero and all undead are restored to sanity.

When the disc arrives back in your space it counts as an attack made against you (but deals no damage to you). As a result it can be used to make a counter attack, or reflected, as long as it hit at least one hostile creature along its path. For the purposes of this counter attack or reflect, the disc counts as having been casted by your choice of one of the hostile creatures it hit along its path, and dealt to you the damage that they took (even though you do not actually take the damage). Charging this spell causes it to conjure three discs, one flying forward as usual and one each flying diagonally to your left and right. Although, only the forward travelling disc stops and makes a return journey, allowing it to be countered or reflected."

Two rounds (12 seconds) after this spell is cast on a corpse, on the turn that this spell was cast, the corpse explodes with ghostflame dealing dark damage to all spaces within 10 feet of the corpse before turning it to ash. The damage you cause from creating simultaneous explosions with this spell does not stack. Charging this spell allows you to cast it on two to five corpses at once, all in a pile which can fit into a five foot grid space. The pile of corpses then explode together after two rounds dealing 2d10 dark damage, plus an additional 1d10 per corpse (as well as damage from scaling as usual)."
